# Morley Hackathon (ZuriHac 2019)

[Morley](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley) is a set of developers tools for the [Michelson language](https://tezos.gitlab.io/master/whitedoc/michelson.html) which is the smart contract language of the Tezos blockchain.
During the hackathon participants will contribute to Morley.

Tasks (will be reformated and expanded):
1. Michelson debugger with ability to execute instructions step-by-step and observe current stack.
2. REPL for Michelson where you can type instructions and interpret them on the fly.
3. Adding new extensions to the Morley language: syntax sugar, check blocks, etc.
